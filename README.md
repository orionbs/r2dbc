# Resilient

This project has one purpose test and explore R2DBC for **Relational** Database.

I'm basically using an H2, which is a relational database, and it is configures as file, not memory.

Because liquibase (JDBC), and h2 (R2DBC) don't use the same in memory h2.

TODO
- test coverage
- performance test
- test benchmark
